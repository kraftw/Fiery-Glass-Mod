# Kraft's Fiery Glass Mod
Hello! This is my first Minecraft Mod! I was **heavily** inspired by the mod [Druidcraft's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/druidcraft) fiery glass. Unfortunately it doesn't seem likely for it to return to the newer versions so I challenged myself to replicate this one aspect of it. Fiery Glass is essentially a direct upgrade from coal with better smelting, brighter torches and even glowing glass.

## Overview

<details>
<summary>Items</summary>

  - **Fiery Glass Shard:** The main resource that allows for the creation of all the other blocks. Fiery glass is found deep underground where deepslate is found. This is to provide the player with some additional challenge in acquiring it since it is a direct upgrade.

  - **Fiery Pickaxe:** A molten pickaxe hot enough to melt the strongest of ores

<summary>Blocks</summary>

  - **Deepslate Fiery Glass Ore:** Fiery Glass glows and so naturally its ore would as well. This also provides a handy little light source while caving similar to glow lichen.

  - **Fiery Block:** This block is a simple way to compact the Fiery Glass you find in the caves. It also is incredibly bright so it can be used for lighting up dark areas. _(also comes in a stairs and slab variant)_

  - **Fiery Glass/Pane:** Ever feel the need for glowing glass for dramatic sake? Ever thought your orange glass was too bland? This glass can fill that void in your heart since its bright and stylish too. While not quite as bright as the Fiery Lamp Block, it still can brighten up any dark area with ease.

  - **Fiery Glass Torch:** Simply a brighter torch with its own glowing orange flame. Very handy for any dark situation you come across. _(only literally dark)_

  - **Fiery Lantern:** A fiery variant of the sea lantern that uses the Fiery Glass Shards

  - **Fiery Glass Lantern:** A custom lantern that harnesses Fiery Glass Shards to glow

  - **Depths Painting:** A custom 1x3 painting done by me :)
  - **Poster Painting:** A custom 2x3 painting done by me inspired by the Minecraft posters of my childhood
